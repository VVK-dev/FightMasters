TO DO IN PROTOTYPE 2:

Addition of the Split and Conduit classes, a delineation between melee and ranged damage, addition of accuracy
and miss chances, a full minion control system, addition of a few new tokens and a modified token system that
has a rock-paper-scissors aspect to it where certain tokens nullify others, a local profile manager that keeps 
track of various account stats for players, a simple bot for players to play against (i.e. single-player).
